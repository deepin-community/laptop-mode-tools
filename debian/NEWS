laptop-mode-tools (1.71-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with the 1.68 release, there are some new files:
  laptop-mode.service, laptop-mode.timer and lmt-poll.service.
  lmt-poll.service is the equivalent of the module battery-level-polling
  .
  To enable battery level polling on a systemd init based machine,
  please enable lmt-poll.service and laptop-mode.timer service files
  .
  On new installations and existing upgrades, these services are
  enabled by default. These new service/timer files currently do not
  honor the CONTROL_BATTERY_LEVEL_POLLING setting

laptop-mode-tools (1.66-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with version 1.65, Laptop Mode Tools has dropped support for
  the usb-autosuspend module. The module and its functionality is now
  provided through the runtime-pm module
  .
  Users are advised to migrate their settings to the new module

laptop-mode-tools (1.64-1) unstable; urgency=low

  With this version, Laptop Mode Tools introduces a basic graphical
  configuration tool to enable/disable different modules. The GUI is
  written in Python/QT4, thus those packages have been added to the
  Recommends section. If you do not intend to use the graphical 
  utility, you can choose to not install the Python QT4 recommends
  .
  This release will also touch all the configuration files. In case
  you have heavily modified configuration files, you may want to
  verify your configuration after the installation is complete
  .
  This could also be the right time to migrate your custom settings 
  to the /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/board-specific/ folder
