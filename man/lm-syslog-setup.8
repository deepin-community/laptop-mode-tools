.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
This manual page documents briefly the 
.I /usr/sbin/lm-syslog-setup
command. lm-syslog-setup was a command to set up the necessary things to enable
laptop mode to switch between different configuration files
based on the power state. This feature and this command has been deprecated
in favor of the configuration-file-control module, which is configured in the
.I /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/configuration-file-control.conf
configuration file. This new module does not require any manual setup.
Existing configurations using the old feature are still supported, however,
new usages of the old feature are not allowed, and lm-syslog-setup
has been disabled accordingly.
